    <h2 id="bio">Bio</h2>
    <p>My name is <strong>Cyris Sullivan</strong> and I am from Massachusetts. I grew up on <b>Cape Cod</b> with my parents and three sisters in a the Town of Orleans. Since I can remember, I've like playing video games and that led me to getting into computers. In middle school, I had a computer class that included both the key components of a computer and coding and from then <i>I fell in love with computers</i>. I went to a vocational school where I studied Information Technologeis and learned all about the basics of computers, networking and cybersecurity. During a job I had working for the Town of Eastham as an IT admin, an allumni from NEIT was hired and worked there with me for a while and <em>he recommended the school which ended up being my top pick and the school I now attend.</em></p>
