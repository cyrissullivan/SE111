            <div>
                <p><b>cricketbat</b> - 27 December 2018<p>
                <p>There aren't many movies better than <em>Ghostbusters</em>. This film expertly balances itself right between the horror genre and the comedy genre.</p>
                <p>The chemistry of the main three characters is undeniable, and when you throw in interesting side characters (such as Rick Moranis as Louis Tully), every scene is a delight to watch. The story is original, the effects are impressive and the jokes are funny - in short, Ghostbusters is a timeless classic.</p>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <ul>
                   
                   <li>Almost none of the scenes were filmed as scripted, most had at least one ad-lib. Most of Bill Murray's lines are ad-libs.</li> 
                   <li>Several shots in the sequence where Venkman, Stantz, and Spengler are thrown off campus were cut.</li> <li>When Louis Tully mingles with his party guests (commenting on the price of the salmon, and so on), the scene is one continuous shot, and almost entirely improvised.</li>
